# Welcome to the Java Data Structures!
Based in [uniovi.ed](https://github.com/ZenMaster91/uniovi.ed).

Here you'll find implementations of popular algorithms and data structures in everyone's favorite new language Java, with detailed explanations of how they work.

If you're a computer science student who needs to learn this stuff for exams -- or if you're a self-taught programmer who wants to brush up on the theory behind your craft -- you've come to the right place!

The goal of this project is to explain how algorithms work. The focus is on clarity and readability of the code, not on making a reusable library that you can drop into your own projects. That said, most of the code should be ready for production use but you may need to tweak it to fit into your own codebase.

Code is compatible Eclipse Oxigen, Gradle and Java 1.8. We'll keep this updated with the latest version of Java.

😍 Suggestions and contributions are welcome! 😍

## How to import into Eclipse Oxigen?
```
